# hello-world
This is my first repository following GitHub's guide

My name is Teryck Haynes. I am interested in learning to code as I consider it a vital skill that will become an autonomously integrated part of the experience of being human. Those who cannot code or understand it will be left behind or worse, taken advantage of to exponential degrees. I wish to see how deep the rabbit hole can go before I say goodbye-world.
